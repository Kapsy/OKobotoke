Bass Bender is an experiment to look at methods of synthesis control that are more intuative and feel based, and less number and knob based. 

Synthesiser interfaces of the past have used very little of the human bodys physical, muscle based intuition, instead relying on knobs that only allow one aspect of sound to be changed at any one time. 

This directly contradicts the way acoustical instruments are played, where simple hand movements change multiple facets of the sound all at once, providing an infinite pallette of unique sonic texture.

By using a touch interface, some of this feel based control is brought back into the world of digital synthesis.
       
How it works:

The bass synth loops the same sequence of notes over.
        
All touches are recorded over 30 seconds and then looped back. 

Further touches will start the recording again.
        
First finger touch: 

X to bend pitch between notes. 
Y to change the overall pitch the notes.

Second finger: creates a fader whos length 'growls' the sound. 

Because the sounds are of very low frequencies, headphones or capable speakers are recommended.
