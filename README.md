# bass bender

'bass bender' explores an alternative audio and synthesizer control interface that is more suitable for a smartphone/tablet touch screen environment. It is built for the Android platform, and uses the libpd library to run a real time Pure Data FM synthesis patch. Please note that 'bass bender' requires the libpd pd-for-android library in order to run. If you're unfamiliar with what libpd and Pure Data are, more info can be found at https://github.com/libpd and http://puredata.info/.
